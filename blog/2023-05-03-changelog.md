# Changelog - Mayday

### General Changes
- WSG no longer covers game installation, MO2 setup, TTW installation, or essential utilities such as xNVSE and 4GB patch.
  - In other words, we now assume/require that you have a working TTW installation via [The Best of Times](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/) before starting the guide.
- In keeping with this assumption, we also assume you know how to install mods in MO2, so the "Installation" steps for most mods have been removed, except where they are non-standard.
- Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.

### Visuals
- Moved Anniversary Anims, B42 Inertia and Compatibility Skeleton here from the now-defunct Animations section.

### Animations
- Removed this section entirely. The mods that survived have been moved to the Visuals section.
