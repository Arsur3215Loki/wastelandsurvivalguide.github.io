We will now install Tale of Two Wastelands. **Make sure both Mod Organizer 2 and the game are closed.**

### Installing TTW

From the [TTW Download](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl) page, download the **3.3.2 Installer** file.
Extract the contents of the **3.3.2 Installer** archive to a new folder called **TTW Installer** in a safe
location outside of any default Windows folders. Once everything has been extracted, open MO2, select the
![MO2](../static/img/mo2%20folders.webp) button at the top, select **Open Mods folder**, and create a folder there
named _Tale of Two Wastelands_.

Back in the **TTW Installer** folder, right-click the **TTW Install.exe** and select **Run As Administrator**.
In the installer, verify that the automatically set file paths for both your Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas
installations are correct. Set the Tale of Two Wastelands install path to the
`C:\Users\**YOUR USERNAME**\AppData\Local\ModOrganizer\TTW\mods\Tale of Two Wastelands` you created earlier:

![TTW Installer](../static/img/install.webp)

Ensure your paths look similar to the example above, then select **Install**. The installer can take a long time -
potentially multiple hours, depending on the speed of your CPU. Be patient and let it do its thing uninterrupted.

## Activating TTW in MO2

Launch MO2, and if TTW was installed to the correct location, you should see the **Tale of Two Wastelands** mod
in the left pane. If you do not see anything, you did not install TTW to the correct folder. Find out where the
files installed to and move them to the `C:\Users\**YOUR USERNAME**\AppData\Local\ModOrganizer\TTW\mods\Tale of Two Wastelands`
you created earlier. Activate the Tale of Two Wastelands mod by checking its box in the left pane, and the right
pane should fill with plugins.

## Installing the Hotfixes

Download and install the [TTW 3.3.2 Hotfix](https://github.com/WallSoGB/The-Best-of-Times/raw/master/files/TTW_3.3.2_Hotfix.7z) manually in MO2.

Refer to the [How to Install Mods](./mo2#how-to-install-mods) section if you do not know what these
instructions mean.

Make sure it is ordered below **Tale of Two Wastelands** and enable its checkbox.
