## About the Guide

Wasteland Survival Guide is a customizable, modular modding guide for Tale of Two Wastelands.
* The **Core Guide** focuses on stability and performance and should be completed by everyone.
* The **Modding Guide** is totally customizable, so feel free to skip mods (or entire sections) 
at your leisure. 
* When you are done installing mods, no matter how many you chose to install 
or skip, you must also complete [Final Steps](finish).

You don't need any prior modding experience to follow the guide, but you will need a basic level
of competence using a computer, and to carefully read and follow all instructions.

:::info Continuing from _The Best of Times_?

If you are continuing from the official [**TTW Installation Guide**](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/),
you should start this guide at the [Utilities](utilities) section. You should already have
nearly everything there with the exception of **AnhNVSE**.
