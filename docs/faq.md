### Application Load Error 5:0000065434
Run your game directly through Steam once. You may also need to restart Steam and/or Mod Organizer 2. If that still doesn't work, place a copy of your Steam.exe (a copy, not a shortcut) into the game's [Root](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/setup.html#terms) folder.
### Can I use Vortex?
<details>
<summary>Not really.</summary>
<p>The guide is oriented completely towards MO2 and takes advantage of a number of its exclusive features. 
You should use whatever mod manager you like, but we are unable to accomodate Vortex users looking for support, as none of us use it.
If using MO2 is a dealbreaker for you, we recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/Zts-tF0nYIk" target="_blank">Gopher's video tutorial</a> instead of this guide.</p>

### DarN instead of VUI+

  - Main Mod:
    - [x] Main Files
    - [ ] Clean Fonts
    - [x] Clean Map Icons

    <RadioButtonCheckedIcon fontSize="small" /> None above<br/>
  - Patches:
    - [ ] Vanilla UI+ Patch

  - [Three-perk Bounty](overhauls#three-perk-bounty)

### I found a mistake in the guide
Please click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the page on the left. It will allow you to [fork the guide and submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with your changes. Thanks for helping out!
### `loadorder.txt` has mods I didn't install
No need to worry; this is actually intentional. MO2 parses the file line-by-line and compares it to your modlist,
and when any given mod is missing, MO2 simply skips it and goes to the next line. The mods that *are* present will
be ordered correctly and anything absent will be ignored. Some mods that were included in older versions of the guide, 
or other popular mods which may cause problems with mods in the guide if they were in the wrong place, are therefore 
included in the file to cover edge cases or outdated installs. This is no cause for concern. As is stressed on the 
[Final Steps](finish) page and in the comments at the top of the file itself, there's no need to read or modify the file.

The only time the loadorder.txt might fail to properly order your mods is if you added mods on your own that aren't 
in the guide. Those mods will need to be manually reordered to the appropriate spot in your loadorder, so if you 
aren't familiar with how to determine the correct spot, how to make patches in xEdit and so on, then it may not be 
a good idea to add additional mods.
### Merge, Rename, Replace?
When installing multiple mods from the same page through MO2, you should **Rename** to the **file name** of the file you downloaded, as described in [The Best of Times](https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/mo2.html#installation_instructions).
### MO2 reports overwritten loose files
MO2 reporting overwritten loose files is fine. As long as your mods in the **left** pane of MO2 are in the exact order as they appear in the guide, these overwrites are intentional and safe.
### MO2 reports files in Overwrite
MO2 reporting files in overwrite is not a cause for concern. These are usually files generated by mods (like configuration INI files) or by programs ran through MO2. These files will still be loaded fine in-game, and will be prioritized as if they are the last mod in the left pane of MO2. Usually, you can just leave these files in the overwrite and ignore the warning. If you like, you can drag the files out of the Overwrite window into their respective mod folders in MO2's left pane.
### No DLC pop-ups on new game
- [Delay DLC Redux](gameplay#delay-dlc-redux-ttw) prevents the DLC pop-ups from showing until you reach the starting location for the DLC. Read the description!
- [SawyerBatty](overhauls#sawyerbatty) distributes the crap pack items throughout the DC wasteland (or NV depending on where you chose to start).
<details>
<summary>SPOILERS: SawyerBatty DLC pack locations for Capital Wasteland</summary>
<p>Caravan Pack - Basement of Red's house in Big Town<br/>
Classic Pack - Trunk of a car South of Megaton<br/>
Mercenary Pack - Talon Outpost South West of Megaton near Grayditch<br/>
Tribal Pack - Back porch of house near Springvale School</p>
</details>

### Ultrawide resolution
In MO2, open **Tools > INI Editor** and make sure you are in the **FalloutCustom.ini** tab and NOT the **Custom.ini** tab. Add the following lines:
```ini
[Display]
; Ultrawide support
iSize W=3440
iSize H=1440
```
Then, in-game, go to Settings/Tweaks and type "ultrawide" in the search bar. Enable the Ultrawide Support tweak by clicking it in the panel on the lefthand side, then exit and restart the game so it takes effect.
