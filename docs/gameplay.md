:::info Perk Every Level

This tweak actually has no effect in TTW, as TTW already grants a perk every level
in non-Hardcore mode, and as for Hardcore, this gamesetting won't actually affect it.
If you want a perk every level in Harcore Mode, install _Hardcore Perk Every Level_
from [Wasteland Supplements](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79005).
