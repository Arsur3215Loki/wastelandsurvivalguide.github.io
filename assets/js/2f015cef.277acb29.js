The max repair amount of items will be capped to the player's\n;   (Repair Skill * 0.6) + 40. For example, with 50 skill, items can only be repaired for up to 70% of their max health,\n;   as opposed to 100% as before, regardless of skill level.\n\nbEnableBigGunsSkill=0\n;   Restores Big Guns as a fully-functional, playable skill.\n\nbProjImpactDmgFix=1\n;   Fixes an engine bug where weapons which fire projectiles that explode upon impact (i.e. Missile Launcher, Grenade\n;   Launcher, etc.) would only apply the damage from the explosion, even on direct hit, ignoring the weapon's hit damage.\n\nbGameDaysPassedFix=1\n;   Fixes an engine bug where the 'GameDaysPassed' and 'GameHour' global timers would \"freeze\" and stop increasing in\n;   game real-time (they would only be increased when sleeping, waiting or fast traveling). This issue directly affected\n;   hardcore needs build-up, which would also freeze in game real-time.\n\nbHardcoreNeedsFix=1\n;   Fixes an issue where some hardcore needs could, for undetermined reasons, end up having negative values. This resulted\n;   in hardcore needs not increasing at the correct rate/at all.\n\nbNoFailedScriptLocks=1\n;   Fixes an engine behavior where a script that has failed (due to any reason) at some point during execution will be\n;   effectively disabled by the game and will no longer be processed again until the game is restarted.\n\nbDoublePrecision=1\n;   Modifies the game's code such that arithmetic/relational operations in scripts are calculated/evaluated with\n;   double-precision floating-point accuracy (instead of single-precision). This was causing various issues, where\n;   relational operators (==, !=, <=, <, >=, >) were not evaluating correctly, and numeric calculations ended with\n;   inaccurate results (this was especially observed with relatively high absolute values). Additionally, this patch also\n;   guarantees no script errors/crashes in cases of division by zero.\n\nbQttSelectShortKeys=1\n;   If enabled, (a) when selecting an item stack in either the inventory, container, or barter menus, holding SHIFT will\n;   transfer/drop the entire stack, whilst holding CTRL will transfer/drop a single item from the stack - thus skipping\n;   the quantity-select menu. (b) Picking up from a container a stack of items that are weightless (such as ammo on\n;   non-hardcore mode) will bring up the quantity-select menu, instead of automatically picking the entire stack.\n\nbLocalizedDTDR=1\n;   When enabled, a distinction will be made between head-armor and body-armor when applying damage reduction from DR/DT.\n;   Head hits will benefit only from DT/DR gained from worn head-armor (if any), whereas body hits, in similar fashion,\n;   only from DT/DR gained from worn body-armor. (Note: Requires bIgnoreDTDRFix to be enabled).\n\nbVoiceModulationFix=1\n;   Adds voice modulation (a slight distortion effect) for talking activators and holotapes.\n\nbSneakBoundingBoxFix=1\n;   Fixes a longstanding Bethesda games' bug where the dimensions of the collision bounding box encapsulating the player\n;   (as well as all NPCs) remained fixed and did not scale to correspond to body posture. This, effectively, had made it\n;   impossible to crawl through breaches and spaces when crouched, despite being able to easily fit through them.\n;   This patch fixes this issue for the player character and human companions.\n\nbEnableNVACAlerts=0\n;   If NVAC is installed, enable this setting to receive in-game alerts in the event an exception has occurred in the game's\n;   code that was successfully handled by NVAC. You will be notified by a corner message, and the error's details will be\n;   printed to the console. This should make it a lot easier to identify the precise circumstances/location in which the\n;   error has occurred.\n\nbLoadScreenFix=1\n;   Forces the load menu to give priority to location-specific load screens (if any are found to match current location)\n;   when selecting a load screen to display.\n\nbNPCWeaponMods=1\nuWMChancePerLevel=1\nuWMChanceMin=5\nuWMChanceMax=30\n;   When enabled, all NPCs will have a chance for their main weapon to include weapon mods. The chance is based on each NPC's level -\n;   the higher the level, the greater the chance. The type of mod(s) is selected randomly from the ones available for the particular\n;   weapon. Weapons have a chance to include multiple mods, though 2 mods is rare, and a fully-modded weapon is uncommon.\n;   uWMChancePerLevel controls chance % increase per NPC level.\n;   uWMChanceMin and uWMChanceMax set the minimum/maximum possible chance.\n;   Formula: Chance(%) = MinOf( uWMChanceMax , MaxOf( uWMChanceMin , Level * uWMChancePerLevel ) )\n\nuNPCPerks=1\n;   Unlocks perks for NPCs (perks will no longer be restricted to the player character and player teammates).\n;   This option has 2 modes:\n;   uNPCPerks=1 : Script commands such as AddPerk/RemovePerk/HasPerk/etc. will work on ANY NPC in the game.\n;   uNPCPerks=2 : (In addition to the above) Perks will automatically be added to human NPCs:\n;                 * 1 random starting Trait.\n;                 * 1 random Perk for every 3 levels of the NPC, up to 10 perks max.\n\nbCreatureSpreadFix=1\n;   Fixes a bug where all non-human actors suffer a massive penalty to weapon-spread (equal to the fUnaimedSpreadPenalty game setting)\n;   due to not having weapon aiming animations, and therefore not technically being able to aim. Note that although this is almost\n;   certainly a bug and an oversight of the game devs, this fix will make certain enemies much deadlier and may affect game balance.\n")),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"rebuild-the-capital"},(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"h3",href:"https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68030"},"Rebuild the Capital")),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Expand the Brotherhood of Steel and their role in the wasteland following the events of Broken Steel.
